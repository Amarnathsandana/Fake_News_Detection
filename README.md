#Fake News Detection: A Comprehensive Machine Learning Approach
**Overview**
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning pipeline for detecting fake news. By leveraging both traditional machine learning models and a deep learning approach, this project systematically preprocesses text data, implements various models, evaluates their performance, and visualizes the results to offer insights into the effectiveness of different methodologies.

**Purpose**
The primary objective of this project is to create an effective and reliable system for identifying fake news. The project seeks to compare the performance of traditional machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and XGBoost, against a deep learning model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). By conducting this comparison, the project aims to determine the most effective model or combination of models for fake news detection.

**Code Structure**
**Data Preprocessing**
Text Processing: The text data undergoes extensive preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for traditional models. For the LSTM model, stemming is applied to better suit the deep learning architecture.
Text Vectorization: Preprocessed text is transformed into a format suitable for model training through vectorization techniques.
**Model Implementation**
Traditional Machine Learning Models: The project implements and evaluates Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and XGBoost models.
Deep Learning Model: An LSTM model is implemented to explore the effectiveness of deep learning in this domain.
**Model Evaluation**
Performance Metrics: The models are evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), and average precision.
Visualizations: The project includes comprehensive visualizations, including ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance plots for the XGBoost model.
**Hyperparameter Tuning**
The project includes careful tuning of hyperparameters for models like Logistic Regression and XGBoost to enhance their performance. These optimizations are crucial for achieving a balance between model accuracy and computational efficiency.
**Input Format**
Raw Text Data: The dataset consists of news articles labeled as either fake or real.
Preprocessed Data: The text data is preprocessed and vectorized to serve as input for model training.
**Output Format**
Model Predictions: Each model provides predictions indicating whether a given news article is classified as fake or real.
Evaluation Metrics: The project outputs detailed evaluation metrics for each model, including visualizations that facilitate comparison and analysis.
